My name is Adam Lemroudi and I am currently in my second year of high school at the Castell d’Estela Institute. This program is part of a Research Project, which has the provisional title “Game theory, a strategic vision”.
The theoretical part of the work focuses on the study of game theory, a branch of mathematics that analyzes strategic decisions.
In order to give a real application to these concepts, I have developed this program called “Auction Helper AI”, which uses game theory to help the user make optimal decisions in a auction.
